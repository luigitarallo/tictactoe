# Tic Tac Toe Game
This is a project created by following the official React documentation to recreate the classic Tic Tac Toe game. While the guide uses JavaScript, I opted to implement it using TypeScript as part of my ongoing effort to improve my technical skills.

## Stack: React + TypeScript + Vite
- Vite for fast development
- TypeScript for type safety and scalability
- React for building the user interface
- CSS for styling
